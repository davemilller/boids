# Boids
[Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) are objects that exhibit flocking behavior based on 3 rules.
* Separation: Avoid collision with others
* Alignment: Align with the average velocity (speed and direction) of the flock
* Cohesion: Move towards the center of mass of the flock

### Running the visualization
Clone this repository and open ```index.html``` locally to see the boids and mess with the code.

### TODO
* Add sliders to adjust separation, alignment, and cohesion factors.
* Add sliders to adjust number of boids, visual range, speed limit.
* Make different shaped boids.
* Have the boids land on the bottom of the screen and take off again.
* Allow collisions (maybe one absorbs the other).
* Be able to draw a path for the boids to follow (attraction).
* Be able to draw walls.
